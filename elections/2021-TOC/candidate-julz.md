Hi I'm Julian. I mostly contribute in Autoscaling, but I try to be useful
across the project, for example I founded the Security Working Group, built the
new prototype docs website, and contributed nice features such as Domain
Mappings, RewriteHost support in networking, and Background Digest Resolution.
I try to chop wood and carry water, making lots of clean up commits and code
reviews, as well as contributing bigger features.

I’m running for the TOC because I’d like to pitch in towards making Knative,
and the Knative technical community, better. Being a relatively new contributor
(without being too new - I have been contributing heavily for well over a year
and am an approver/lead in 3 WGs) means I bring a fresh perspective, as well as
recent experience of going through the contributor ladder, to the TOC. My
priorities would be building and growing the technical community: making it
much easier to get started and contribute (including extensions), clarifying
and improving the path to approver and lead, and encouraging us to think about
how to drive down the time to the “this is obviously better” moment for users
trying to use Knative.
